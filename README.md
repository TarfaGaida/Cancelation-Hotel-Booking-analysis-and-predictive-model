# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis & Predictive Model
*by Tarfa Gaida*

## Overview

This project leverages transaction and historical hotel booking data to analyze customer behaviors and develop a predictive model to identify high-risk customers likely to cancel their hotel bookings. The insights from this analysis aim to support better business decisions and reduce revenue loss from cancellations.

## Business Impact

- **Risk Identification:** Accurately flag potential booking cancellations, empowering proactive customer engagement.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Provides actionable insights to improve booking policies, customer retention, and revenue management.
- **Visualization:** Key findings are illustrated through charts for intuitive understanding and presentation to stakeholders.

## Technology Stack

- **Primary language:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Data Analysis & Modeling:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- **Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
